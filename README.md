# simtel_random_imei
Simtel 7100 modem IMEI can be changed. This script uses Osmocom TAC database to make real IMEIs.

Remember to check your local legislation; this might be illegal in your country. 

Usually changing IMEI is needed to circumvent network operator restrictions in many countries.

You should never use zeroes as IMEI; most operators do not let such device to work; therefore you need legit-looking IMEI.

Using arbitrary or non-existing IMEI can cause odd side effects from law enforcement contacting you or terminating your mobile subscription.

This script helps you make valid looking IMEI code. You have a slight chance to hit stolen or blacklisted IMEI, but hey, you have a minor chance to win in the national lottery!

Use at your own risk.
Use with caution!

This script is written with and for Raspberry Pi.
